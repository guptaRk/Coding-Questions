Let's Party
In Danceland, one person can party either alone or can pair up with another person.  Can you find in how many ways they can party if there are N people in Danceland? Input Format
Given only argument A of type Integer, number of people in Danceland.
Output Format
Return a single integer N mod 10003, i.e number of ways people of Danceland can party.
Constraints
1 <= N <= 1e5 
Example
Input:
    N = 3

Output :
    4

Explanation :
    Let suppose three people are A, B, and C.
    There are only 4 ways to party as,
    (A, B, C) All party alone
    (AB, C) A and B party together and C party alone
    (AC, B) A and C party together and B party alone
    (BC, A) B and C party together and A party alone
    here 4 % 10003 = 4, so answer is 4.
    
    
    solution:
    
    int Solution::solve(int A) {
    int a[A+1];
    if(A<=2)return A;
    a[0]=1;a[1]=1;a[2]=2;
    for(int i=3;i<=A;i++){
        a[i]=a[i-1]+((i-1)*a[i-2])%10003;
        a[i]%=10003;
    }
    return a[A]%10003;
    }
